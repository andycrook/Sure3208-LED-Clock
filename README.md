# Sure3208-LED-Clock

This is a display driver for a set of Sure 32x08 LED matrix panels, running on HT1632c chips.

It is pure python and I'm using it with a raspberry pi pico running micropython

main.py is a demonstration of the abilities

font.py holds the font(s) for the matrix

sure3208.py is the display module itself
